# LiteLock

LiteLock is a simple file encryption utility that uses the Rijndael cipher.

You simply drag and drop files/folders to Encrypt/Decrypt.

When encrypting, you will be prompted for a password which you enter twice.

If you select "overwrite original file" (default), it will also encrypt the original file before deleting it.

Here's a gif demonstrating how it works:
